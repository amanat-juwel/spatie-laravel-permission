Usage
This is not a package - it's a full Laravel project that you should use as a starter boilerplate, and then add your own custom functionality.

Clone the repository with git clone
Copy .env.example file to .env and edit database credentials there
Run composer install
Run php artisan key:generate
Run php artisan migrate --seed (it has some seeded data - see below)
That's it: launch the main URL and login with default credentials admin@admin.com - password
This boilerplate has one role (administrator), one permission (users_manage) and one administrator user.
